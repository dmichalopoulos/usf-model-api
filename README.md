# usf-model-api

## Summary
This repo contains a prototype REST API service for serving model predictions from the `Store Item Demand
Forecasting Challenge` Kaggle competition. The web app is built using FastAPI, and is designed to 
be run as a containerized application using Docker. During image build, all `python` packaging and 
dependency management is handled by `pipenv`.

Once running, the app supports the option of generating predictions from one of two models, depending
on the contents of the `POST` request payload:
 * A `CatBoostRegressor`
 * A `LightGBMRegressor`

Upon launch, the app the app port-forwards to 0.0.0.0:80 on the host machine, and exposes the following 
endpoints:
 
 * `[GET] /sales-forecast` - Application root
 * `[POST] /sales-forecast/predict` - accepts a JSON payload containing the features for a single prediction, and returns the predicted value
 * `[GET] /sales-forecast/status` - Returns a 200 status code if the app is running

## Getting Started
### Host Machine Prerequisites
 * `docker` installed and running
 * Compatible with either `linux/amd64` or `linux/arm64` architectures

### Build the Docker Image
From the root of the repo:

 * To build the `linux/arm64`-compatible image, run:
   ```shell
   ./build.sh arm  # ./build.sh with now args will accomplish the same
   ```

 * To build the `linux/amd64`-compatible image, run:
   ```shell
   ./build.sh amd
   ```
Note
----
 * If your host machine is an M1 Mac, building the `arm64` image is recommended. It will build much
   faster, and likely run more efficiently than the `amd64` image.
 * Conversely, if your host machine is an Intel Mac, building the `amd64` image is recommended.
 * In either case, if you have an architecture mismatch between the host and the image, you may see
   messages like the following when you run the steps in the next section:
   ```shell
      WARNING: The requested image\'s platform (linux/amd64) does not match the detected host platform 
      (linux/arm64/v8) and no specific platform was requested
   ```
   This is expected, and can be ignored.

## Launching the Application
Once the image is built, getting the app up and running can be fully managed `./run.sh` located in
the repo root.

### (1) Running Unit Tests (Optional)
Several unit tests were created during app development, and they are included if you wish to run them:
```shell
./run.sh pytest
```

### (2) Training the Models
Before the web app can be launched, the `catboost` and `lightgbm` models must first be trained and
saved locally (serialized as `.pkl` files). Doing so is another simple one-liner:
```shell
./run.sh train
```

### (3) Launching the Web App
Once the models are trained, the web app can be easily launched as follows:
```shell
./run.sh serve
```

This will run the app in the foreground on the `FastAPI` server, which will display output that looks
like the following:
```shell
FastAPI      Starting production server üöÄ
 
             Searching for package file structure from directories with         
             __init__.py files

             from service.app import app
 
       app   Using import string: service.app:app

```

Now the webapp is up and running, and additionally is port-forwarding to `0.0.0.0:80` on the host 
machine.

## Using the Web App
### Viewing the API Docs
You can view the Swagger documentation automatically generated by `FastAPI` by navigating to `http://0.0.0.0:80/docs`
in your browser.

### Sending Prediction Requests
The web app will automatically route prediction requests to either the `catboost` or `lightgbm` model, 
depending on the `model_id` field value in each `SalesPredictionRequest` object in the `POST` request 
payload. For example:

Request:
```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
  '[{"model_id": "catboost", "date": "2025-04-01", "store": 1, "item": 2}, {"model_id": "lgbm", "date": "2025-04-01", "store": 1, "item": 2}, {"model_id": "catboost", "date": "2025-04-02", "store": 2, "item": 2}]' \
  http://0.0.0.0:80/sales-forecasting/predict
```

Response:
```json

    "message": "Prediction request successful.",
    "predictions": [
        {
            "prediction_id": "894068c7-225c-4c34-894d-c538976acbb0",

    ]
}
